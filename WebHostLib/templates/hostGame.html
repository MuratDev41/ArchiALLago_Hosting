                This page allows you to host a game which was not generated by the website. For example, if you have
                generated a game on your own computer, you may upload the zip file created by the generator to
                host the game here. This will also provide a tracker, and the ability for your players to download
                their patch files if the game is core-verified. For Custom Games, you can find the patch files in
                the output .zip file you are uploading here. You need to manually distribute those patch files to
                your players.
